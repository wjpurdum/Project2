User Story MVP:
  As a user, I should be able to public radio stations and the folk/bluegrass programs they play. Informations should include:
    For station:
    1. Station acronym
    2. Broadcast city
    3. Broadcast area
    4. A link the station's website

    For program:
    1. Program name
    2. Program host
    3. Broadcast time (day and time)
    4. Program description
    5. Link to program home page on station

  As a user, I should also be able to contribute to the site by adding a program that does not appear on the station's program list.

  Silver:
  As a user, I should be able to add a comment to a program, and delete or update my comment. I should not be able to edit or delete any comments that I did not generate.

  Gold:
  As a user, I should be able to log in and "favorite" the programs I like. My favorites should appear on "my favorites" page. Each favorite should have 2 links: 1 that links back to that program page, and one that links to the program's external site where there are archived episodes.
